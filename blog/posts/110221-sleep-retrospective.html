          <h1 class="blog-text" style="text-align: center;">A Retrospective on Lensing My First Short Film</h1>
          <p class="blog-byline">by Dawn Moore</p>

          <div class="blog-text">
            <p>My name is Dawn Moore, cinematographer, colorist, camera assistant, gaffer, grip, editor, graphics and engine programmer, web developer, she/her, taken, 22,
              enjoys Miller High Life with pizza, et cetera et cetera et cetera. Today we're going to deep dive into my very first "Big Kid" short film I
              lensed in my time at Webster University - <i>Sleep.</i></p>

            </div>

            <p>Sleep tells the story of June, an overworked insomniac film editor who begins losing her sense of time and hallucinates horrifying events.</p>
            <p>I learned quite a lot on this set - how to lead a team, what makes good lighting, and what can go wrong when you don't follow the golden rule of literally anything: keep it simple.</p>
            <p>Let's set the stage. It's January, 2019. I've just started my fourth and final semester at Webster University, in my sophomore year. For personal and financial reasons,
              this would be my last semester at Webster. I managed to weasel my way into the Advanced Camera and Light class taught by June Kyu Park, an accomplished South Korean filmmaker and
              cinematographer, and someone I still hold an immense respect for. (Kyu, if you're reading this, let's grab coffee sometime ðŸ‘Œ)</p>
            <p>The concept behind this class was simple - students would learn how to operate more advanced camera and lighting equipment,
              along with a refined lesson in lighting theory and techniques. Students would execute this knowledge in a short film production
              in collaboration with a director from the Advanced Directing class, and a producer from the Advanced Producing class.
              This was the basic structure of the 2000-level Film and TV Production courses at Webster pre-COVID.
              I honestly have no idea how it functions post-COVID and frankly I don't want to think about that.</p>
            <p>A large part of being in the Advanced Camera and Light class was having access to the Intermediate Package at Webster's Media Center.
              This bestows access to things like Kino-Flo light packages, 1K and 2K tungsten fresnels, most common grip clamps, light meters, and extra camera support like hi-hats and maintenance kits.
              It also provides access to slightly more advanced cameras, so this is probably a good point to introduce the URSA.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>THE URSA</h3>
            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://www.hurlbutacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/image001_sm1-1.jpg" alt="Photo of Blackmagic URSA 4K v1"/>
            </div>

            <p>Released by Blackmagic Design in August 2014, the Blackmagic URSA 4K v1 is an absolute cow of a camera. Unladen, the body alone weighs 16.52 pounds.
              Two built-in 5-inch capacitive touchscreen interfaces adorn both the left and right side of the camera body, along with a 10.1-inch TFT-LCD flip-out articulating monitor on its left side.
              It shipped in both EF and PL lens mounts, and is capable of shooting in ProRes and CinemaDNG RAW internally at a max resolution of 4000 by 2160, with a
              reported 12 stops of dynamic range on a slightly-smaller-than-Super35 global shutter sensor.
              Dotted all around the case are connectors for just about anything you'd imagine on a professional set - SDI, XLR, LANC, etc. Two glowing audio meters stood out like
              monoliths on the right side of the camera. And it doesn't stop there - Blackmagic designed this camera with an open and future-proof mindset.
              You could upgrade and repair any part of the camera. Has new sensor technology made your camera obsolete? Not a problem - just remove the sensor turret and pop in the new one.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">

            </div>
            <p>Hell, they even sold a model <i>without</i> a sensor to use as an external recorder for other cameras!</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://www.hdvideopro.com/images/stories/2015/apr/ursa/3.jpg" alt="Blackmagic URSA being used as an external recorder"/>
            </div>
            <p>Blackmagic designed the URSA primarily as a response to criticism of their original Cinema Camera and Production Camera lineup,
              and in fact the v1 URSA model uses the same global-shutter sensor as the Production Camera. The critiques of the original were simple:
              it's too odd a form factor and isn't viable on larger productions with a more populated camera team.
              So of course, Blackmagic took this criticism to heart and designed a camera that literally only a team could use.</p>
            <p>Despite the lofty goals, Blackmagic swung a bit too close to the sun, and the URSA never took off as the industry continued to be dominated by RED and Arri.
              It wasn't until the release of the URSA Mini that the name began to take hold as a commonplace and reliable camera lineup, which struck a tender balance between the compact
              feel and budget price of the original Cinema Camera and the professional niceties of the full-size URSA.</p>
            <p>And despite everything, I love this camera cow.</p>
            <p>I spent multiple days checking out this camera from the Media Center and putting it together in the common area of Sverdrup Hall.
              I experimented with it, I shot every format available on it, I pushed every button just to see what it did. I had a PDF of the manual with me and read it from
              beginning to end at least twice. I loved this cyberpunk boom box with an iPad strapped to the side with all my heart.
              In my defense, it gave a much more pleasing and usable image than the Sony FS5, which was the only other camera option available in the Intermediate Package.
              I think part of it was my lifelong fascination with Blackmagic products, even since early high school.
              Hell, in my freshman year, we were given original Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Cameras, and it genuinely felt like a dream come true.
              I'd ogled over the BMPCC and the URSA for years before I even went to Webster.</p>
            <p>Naturally, whichever project I ended up on in the class, I knew I would end up using the URSA.
              The first challenge came fairly quickly. Despite being a baby DP, I knew that I favored naturalistic handheld shots over locked-down tripod or dolly shots, and
              that whatever project I ended up on, I was going to be shouldering a 30-pound camera rig.
              So I did as much research and experimentation as I could to build a well-balanced rig. One that I could operate for extended periods of time as a scrawny college student,
              living off of mac and cheese and canned ravioli. I came across this video by Shane Hurlbut, describing his ideal rig for a mix of shoulder and tripod shooting, and
              treated it pretty much as gospel.</p>

            <div class="blog-image"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVXFepFhtRw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

            <p>The Media Center didn't really have a proper shoulder rig specifically for the URSA, but they did have basic shoulder rig accessories for anything compatible with 15mm rods,
              so I took the rails and the handles and slapped them on, and used a balled-up jacket for cushioning.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Later on, we found ourselves borrowing a
            Tilta Nucleus-M follow focus and Teradek Bolt Pro 600 wireless transmitter system. It all came together and worked like a charm.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>HEY KID, I'M PUTTIN' TOGETHER A CREW</h3>
            <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:41%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7WIM4XW9PQIUtVLy" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nerdist-star-wars-solo-3o7WIM4XW9PQIUtVLy">via GIPHY</a></p>

            <p>A few weeks into the semester, all three classes met in one penultimate meeting. You would pitch yourself, hope you landed the project with the best people, and pray.
               After the directors pitched their scripts, all the DPs showed their reels, and when that was done, the networking hour commenced.</p>

            <p>As soon as the clock began, Ethan, the producer of Sleep, pounced on me and immediately asked if I would be interested in lensing the film.
              I hesitated, since I didn't want to lock myself into a script without seeing other opportunities, and gave him a tentative "I'll think about it."
              But after walking around and getting lukewarm responses from other directors and producers, I walked right back to Ethan and accepted the offer.</p>
            <p>I knew Sleep was a more-than-decent script, since its writer and director, Liam Webner, was and is a close friend of mine, and I had followed its development
              since before the semester began. I had no doubt the film would turn out, at the very least, halfway decent. Over the next few weeks, he and I would meet,
              discuss the shotlist, go over equipment, crew, and plan the shit out of this. We even dedicated a day to figuring out exactly which lighting contrast ratio we wanted - 4-to-1 or 16-to-1.
              We settled on the latter and almost never used fill for the entire shoot. Once we had a location locked in, we diagramed everything to the best of our ability.
              These became a somewhat decent help on set, but we ended up winging most of the lighting as we saw it.</p>

            </div>

            <p>I'm actually not sure where or when I first met Liam. I think it was sometime during our freshman year - I'm pretty sure he was the gaffer on a project I was producing.
              That would have been my very first project at Webster, actually. It turned out okay.</p>
            <p>He would later go on to accidentally lens my first proper short film as a director, Mantis Shrimp, which aesthetically turned out great, but on the whole I would like to forget
            that film ever existed.</p>
            <p>Beyond his confident and stocky Brooklyn demeanor, I could tell early on that directing wasn't Liam's strong suit, and wasn't something he was interested in for the long term.
              He's always been interested in the technical side of things - lighting, cameras, tinkering. That summer after we finished Sleep, he would purchase an entire
              lighting package of broken or defunct lights, fix them all up, and have a fully functioning light kit for a fraction of the cost, and all the knowledge that fixing old
              lights can give you. With Sleep, all he knew was that he had a script and wanted it made, so he threw everything he could at making it.
              I could do nothing but respect the hell out of that.
              He never really went on to direct anything else throughout his time at Webster or after, but he did go on to become one of the best damned gaffers in and around St. Louis.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://i.ibb.co/LxbGYn1/DSC0196.jpg" alt="Liam looking through a camera monitor" height="500px"/>
            </div>
            <p>Hand-picking a camera and lighting crew became my responsibility early on. We already had to utilize a gaffer from the class
              (part of the grade was gaffing a project as well as lensing), so that was filled, and the key grip was Liam's close friend Justin May,
              which I wasn't about to argue with. On top of that, a single student was the odd-one-out in the class and didn't get picked for a single project.
              He was technically assigned as my co-cinematographer for the grade, but the professor told me under-the-table that he would be fine if I only had him as AC.
              So, my 2nd AC slot was filled, leaving the 1st AC as my only variable in this equation.</p>
            <p>My first pick for 1st AC was my friend Hezekiah Condron, an incredible focus puller and one of the most prolific camera assistants in St. Louis.
              His availability didn't pan out, and so about a week or so away from shooting, he replaced himself with his friend Adrian Proleiko.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>THE RUSSIAN</h3>

            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://i.ibb.co/vkDkdQ0/image.png" alt="Photo of Adrian Proleiko" height="300px"/>
            </div>

            <p>Adrian Proleiko can only be truly described as an enigma given physical form. Primarily a gaffer and steadicam operator and incredible DP in his own right, Adrian has worked on stuff you've heard of.
              And when we met him during the production of Sleep, he was 17 years old.</p>
            <p>Born in St. Louis to a Russian father and American mother, his family would return to Moscow at an early age, and he would do most of his growing up there.
              According to himself, with no real way to verify the story, he landed his first job in film on the set of Resident Evil: Retribution when he was 9 years old.
              Legend has it that while they were shooting on his street in Moscow, he followed the grips around with a pot of coffee. His offer - in exchange for coffee,
              he'd follow them around and learn. The grips, realizing the nearest coffee shop was too far away to walk, decided it was worth it.
              Once they learned he also spoke English fluently thanks to his partway American upbringing, they kept him around as an unofficial PA.</p>
            <p>Since then, he's worked with every advanced filmmaking tool you can think of, from technocranes to Chapman dollies to 100kW diesel generators with accompanying distro.
              He's been a stunt driver for Michael Bay. He even took all the behind-the-scenes photos from Sleep in this article.</p>
            <p>And now, he was my 1st AC.</p>
            <p>I first met Adrian in-person during equipment loadout the night before our first day of production. He spoke with a weird hybrid British accent,
              which I later learned is what he sounds like when he's tired. Otherwise he sounds like any other deep-voiced American teen that just so happens to also speak fluent Russian.
              His tall and lanky frame hides his surprising strength, which can probably lift a Fisher dolly single-handedly.</p>
            <p>Adrian surprisingly wasn't actually too experienced with pulling focus - he was here mostly as a favor to Hezekiah.
              But he didn't seem to have any distaste for being on our meager student set. Adrian lived and breathed film work.
              He has an incredible respect for the craft of cinematography, and finds it infinitely more fulfilling to spend time on unpaid passion project sets as opposed to
              staying home and doing nothing. That doesn't mean he'd always work for free, but if the project is enticing and the people are fun to be around, he'd happily show up.
              We later learned he turned down a gig with FOX to work on our set, which astounded the lot of us, but makes sense in retrospect.</p>
            <p>After showing him around the camera build we were using, and getting Hezekiah's follow focus up and running, along with troubleshooting any issues,
              we loaded the equipment into our cars, went home, and we all tried to get as much rest as we could for the first day of production.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>SORRY RANDOM AIRBNB OWNER</h3>

            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://i.ibb.co/0qDfjfq/DSC0198.jpg" alt="Photo of Adrian Proleiko" height="500px"/>
            </div>

            <p>We shot in an AirBnB in south-city St. Louis during our first two days of production. Looking back, we had way too much crew and way too little space.
              But despite the nerves, I muscled through and tried my hardest to corral the team and make some kind of cohesive whole.</p>
            <p>My gaffer, Jake DeNunzio, was fairly out of his element. A VFX artist by trade, he runs a tokusatsu-themed YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DaikaijuLegends">Daikaiju Legends</a>, and has a niche but
              sizable following making Ultraman and Godzilla fan videos, alongside his long-running series Zone Fighter. But today, at least for the grade, he was my gaffer,
              and somehow pretty damn good at it. He had a great sense of how light bounced and diffused through a room, and was a genuine help in figuring out some tough
              puzzles. I remember hitting him up a couple times after Sleep to gaff a few shorts, but naturally, he wanted to focus on his incredibly high production value
              tokusatsu films.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://i.ibb.co/2WvsXRC/vlcsnap-2021-11-01-16h46m06s676.png" alt="Frame grab from Sleep - lead actress looking off camera" height="500px"/>
            </div>
            <p>A lot of our setups were straightforward enough. 2K through the nearest window with some CTB gel, another 300 or 650 inside with CTB for fill and ambience.
              I'd seen so many of my fellow students overlight and shy away from contrast, and I made it my mission to embrace shadow and have a metaphorical cone around the
              camera where I'd never put a light. I tried to keep everything as simple as possible, and not attempt something overcomplicated. And then I attempted something overcomplicated.</p>
            <p>I can't remember if it was the first or second day of production. Likely the first. I got a real bad case of Big Head and wanted to try
              something absolutely insane - an in-camera day to night transition. To accomplish this, I had a 2K outside the nearest window, duvetyne covering the living room window
              and all others, and I would tactically pan the camera as we slowly raised up tungsten lights inside and blocked the only uncovered window.
              The only problem was that I had nothing to block the outside window, and no curtains to cover up whatever I blocked it with.
              I think we were going to try replacing the window with visual effects, which Jake could pull off without issue.
              After struggling to dig up a spare floppy or flag or anything we could use, someone suggested using a furniture pad held up by two c-stands outside the window.
              So naturally, that's what we ended up doing.</p>
            <p>If you go back and listen to the audio, you can hear grips outside synchronizing their c-stand raising on dance counts of 1-2-3-4. One of them even suggested using a sea shanty.</p>
            <p>We ended up scrapping the shot entirely and simply going with a smash cut, and worse for wear after the time spent setting up.
              I'm pretty sure that the entire scene was cut out of the final short anyway.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>WHAT DOES A D.P. EVEN DO ANYWAY?</h3>
            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://i.ibb.co/8XRbCfP/vlcsnap-2021-11-01-16h43m24s466.png" alt="Frame grab from Sleep - therapist looking off camera" height="500px"/>
            </div>
            <p>In the second block of shooting, which was also our third and final day, we no longer had Adrian, and Hezekiah finally made time to be my 1st AC.
              No longer in the AirBnB, we were back on campus at Webster University, in the Health Center building, shooting a scene where our lead actor visits a therapist.
              The initial plan was to shoot in the basement, which had a nice large counseling space, and would have made lighting much easier.</p>
            <p>Jake could no longer gaff for me on this third day, so Justin took his place, and a new key grip, Ethan Canby, filled his place in turn.
              On top of that, our location contact offered us a new room upstairs, in a smaller space, with the benefit being that it looked more like a formal therapist's office.
              Naturally, Liam liked it better, and we moved upstairs. So now I had to come up with a new lighting plan in a smaller space with a new crew.</p>
            <p>What we ended up with was a more complex lighting rig than necessary, and I remember having to actively reel in the crew from doing something overcomplicated,
              like throwing an eye light on the camera when it wasn't needed. If I had my way entirely, we would have just bounced a single tungsten light off a bounce board and
              shaped that as needed with a flag or two. Instead, we had a chinese lantern hanging from the ceiling, and another light on the ground bouncing into where the chinese lantern was,
              and another light somewhere else doing essentially nothing.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
              <img style="box-shadow: 10px 10px orange" src="https://i.ibb.co/ThSWjjL/vlcsnap-2021-11-01-16h43m09s394.png" alt="Frame grab from Sleep - lead actress looking off camera" height="500px"/>
            </div>

            <p>Despite the rough start, once we got settled in and started popping off takes, we hit a stride. Hezekiah never missed focus once, but it's not like we strained him much,
              since we were on sticks for the whole day. We wrapped on time and had a very nice looking film to boot.</p>
            <p>On top of everything, we also shot RAW, much to the chagrin of our professors who discouraged us from doing so. We made sure to have a dedicated DIT on set to ensure
              all footage was properly handled, which was also apparently a new thing to some of the other students on our set, who wondered why the 2nd AC wasn't managing media.</p>

            <h3>THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD</h3>

            <p>When all was said and done, I somehow impressed the professors enough to barely get any usable critique on my work. In Kyu's own words, that fueled my confidence for months,
              "This looks really good." The only real critique I ever got was from Adrian, who said that while my light placement and usage was on point,
              the thing I needed to work on was shaping it and softening it.</p>
            <p>In post-production, our script supervisor, Kayla Bernhoester, was also tasked with editing. She pumped out a decent cut good enough for the final screening at the end of the semester.
               I was supposed to do a color grade pass, but time constraints didn't allow that. I would still very much like to do another color pass on it when I get a chance.</p>
            <p>Liam and I always talked about getting another cut out, and I believe we did, but it still has yet to be publicly released. And as a student project,
              where we were all definitely still learning, I'm okay with that. I've shot much better things since.</p>
            <p>So what did I learn?</p>
            <h4>#1 Small Crews Are Great</h4>
            <p>You don't need 20 people on a student film set. Too many cooks spoil the broth yada yada.</p>
            <h4>#2 Keep It Simple</h4>
            <p>Use as few lights as possible to get the shot you need, and don't do anything you're not 100% sure you're capable of doing with the resources you have. You'll also get the benefit of always wrapping on time or early.
              I've rarely, if ever, lensed a set where we ran late since Sleep.</p>
            <h4>#3 Communicate Goodly</h4>
            <p>Have a clear and effective line of communication to every single person you're working with. That includes your camera assistants, your DIT, your gaffer and key grip,
              and every single grip and electrician under them. You're not the head of the snake. You are the snake. Chain of command is a load of bull.</p>
            <p>Since Sleep, I've lensed about 9 other shorts and part of a feature. Sleep absolutely had an influence in how I approached every single one of them
              and will approach every single one after them. I even shot on the URSA one more time before it officially kicked the bucket and Webster acquired new cameras to replace it.
              I met incredible people like Adrian, whom I worked with dozens of times afterward and can happily call a friend. And after I finished Sleep,
              I belted out one last swan song with Double Bill before leaving Webster behind at the end of the semester and going full-time freelance.</p>
            <p>Is Sleep a good film? For a student one, maybe yeah. Story's a bit pretentious I guess. But at least it's shot well, and I have a lot of people to thank for that.</p>
