        <h1>My name is Dawn, she/her.</h1>
        <p>I've been a freelance cinematographer and colorist since 2018.</p>
        <p>In that time, I've had the honor of lensing and coloring countless short films and a feature, both narrative and documentary.</p>
        <p>In addition to cinematography, I've done extensive work in grip and electric, and as an assistant camera. I wouldn't really be able to call myself a DP if I didn't know how to light, or how to assemble a camera and pull focus.</p>
        <p>I've had a lifelong passion for all things film. I got the itch just as everyone else did - a laptop for christmas, Windows Movie Maker, and a 360p webcam. I was the annoying kid in high school who would always pull her friends into crazy VFX-heavy films despite not knowing
          how I'd execute a shot in post. I breathed screenplay formatting, drank Premiere Pro, and ate f/stops as a mid-afternoon snack.</p>
        <p>I briefly attended Webster University as a Film, TV and Video Production major, where I met an intense gaggle of friends that I still love and work with to this day.</p>
        <p>Ever since going full-time freelance in late 2019, I've had the pleasure of working with clients like Vidzu Media, Coolfire Studios, and many other fantastic groups of creators based in and around St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Outside of film, I'm a bit of an indie music snob, and consider bands like Modest Mouse, Wolf Parade, and many others like them as personal favorites; but I've happily dipped into 90s gangster rap, indie pop, synthwave, the works.</p>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned to a short-lived childhood hobby - computer programming. I taught myself C++ over the course of 2020, and fooled around with OpenGL to create my own pseudo-game engines and renderers.
          In 2021, I tried my hand at web dev, learning JavaScript and HTML. You're reading the result of that. (<a href=https://github.com/filmbrood/Filmbrood-Website>Take a look yourself!</a>)</p>
        <h1>So what's "Filmbrood?"</h1>
        <p>Filmbrood is a weird branding / pseudonym / post-production house / "production company" I've been operating under since 2015, when I was 16 years old. I've been using it so long that the name just kinda stuck. It's not a company, since it's just me, but it's cooler than just putting my own name on things.</p>
