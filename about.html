          <h1>My name is Dawn, she/her.</h1>
          <p>I've been a freelance cinematographer since 2018, and a full-time member of the team at Vidzu Media as an editor and camera operator since 2022.</p>
          <p>In that time, I've had the honor of lensing dozens of short films, documentaries, corporate videos, and the occasional commercial.</p>
          <p>In addition to cinematography, I've done extensive work in grip and electric, and as an assistant camera. I wouldn't really be able to call myself a DP if I didn't know how to light, or how to assemble a camera and pull focus.</p>
          <p>I've had a lifelong passion for all things film. I got the itch just as everyone else did - a laptop for christmas, Windows Movie Maker, and a 360p webcam. I was the annoying kid in high school who would always pull her friends into crazy VFX-heavy films despite not knowing
            how I'd execute a shot in post. I breathed screenplay formatting, drank Premiere Pro, and ate f/stops as a mid-afternoon snack.</p>
          <p>I briefly attended Webster University as a Film, TV and Video Production major, where I met an intense gaggle of friends that I still love and work with to this day.</p>
          <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned to a short-lived childhood hobby - computer programming. I taught myself C++ over the course of 2020, and fooled around with OpenGL to create my own pseudo-game engines and renderers.
            In 2021, I tried my hand at web dev, learning JavaScript and HTML. You're reading the result of that. (<a href=https://github.com/filmbrood/Filmbrood-Website>Take a look yourself!</a>)</p>
